Assaying MSD:-

This focuses on exploring the Million Song Dataset and capturing patterns, trends in songs with respect to year. 

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing trends in music through years with the help of Million Song Dataset (MSD). The main idea is to build an efficient model that is capable of predicting the year and visualize trends for a given set of music acoustics and attributes. The trained model must capture the patterns in song tracks across years in order to do this. These learned patterns are the trends we analyze and visualize.

Our larger aim through this project is understanding and helping others understand the evolution of music over the years, which beats and frequencies are still in trend and thus providing a vision to people in the music industry about various aspects related to music.
